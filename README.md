# SEC Litigation Scraper
Scrapes all instances of insider trading from  articles on sec.gov, saves them in a folder by year. 
Instances of insider trading that cannot be scraped (formatting issues) but are relevant are dumped into an error log.

Should be cleaned up more, use and create exceptions instead of an errorlog.
